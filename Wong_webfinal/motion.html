        For my animation project, I created a animation that was about a character gettiing a haircut and transforming into a whole new person after the haircut. I had the most fun working on this project because it's amazing to see my work move into the direction that I expected. However, this was also the project that I spent the most time on because of the frame work and exporting files to make sure the animation can run smoothly.
